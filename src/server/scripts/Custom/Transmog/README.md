# Transmogrification [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Rochet2/TrinityCore.svg?branch=transmog_3.3.5)](https://travis-ci.org/Rochet2/TrinityCore)

#### About
Transmogrification allows you to change the display of an item to something else.
You can use any item in your bags as source of display, as long as it fits the requirements.
Requirements can be tweaked in the server configuration file.
Basically any item should work with transmogrification. Custom items as well. No item is hardcoded to the system.
Has a feature to store sets of displays. This can be removed before compiling or in the configuration file.
Made for 3.3.5a.<br />
